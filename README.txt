	Weather Forecast app is a simple app, for Android mobile phones, that offers 4 days forecast for a selected 
location (from preferred locations list). 

INTERACTION WITH THE APP
	First activity displays the list of locations added by the user by pushing Add button and saved to intern file
by pushing Commit button. Long click on a list item removes location from the list; both add and remove operations are 
persistent only after pushing commit button. Click on a list item displays 4 days weather forecast for the selected 
location if it is known.

NOTES
	The app was tested for cities/towns with names containing English Alphabet letters and space.
	Device rotation is not supported.

TODOs:
* list 4 days forecast in a grid view
